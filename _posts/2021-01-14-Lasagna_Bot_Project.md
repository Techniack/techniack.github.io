# Introducing the LasagnaBot
## Tha Whatnow?
The LasagnaBot! Basically, its a 3D printer that makes Lasagna at the press of a button. The printer will be built around a customized version of the Ender 5 Max with a toolchanging system to apply the different fixins. 


## Who Came Up With This?
The LasagnaBot is a project that spurred out of a joke on the Voidstar Labs Discord server. Someone said that the owner "Should make a bot that prints Lasagna" during a discussion about Food 3D printing. Of course I cant leave a project pitch like that unanswered, and thus the LasagnaBot project was born!

# 3D Printing Help Bot
## What Is It?
The 3D Printing Help Bot is a little bot I whipped up to help answer the most common questions people have regarding getting started with 3D Printing. It has some of the best guides I could find in the 3D printing community as well as search engines for [FilamentColors.xyz](https://filamentcolors.xyz) and the [RepRap Wiki](https://reprap.org) [indev].

## Why Do I Need It?
Are you sick of answering the same starter questions and needing to link to the same resources ***over and over***? No? Well you should be!

## Who Made It?
This project was designed by Techniack with input from matt Stultz, Billie Ruben, and The Filament Librarian. If you would like to help or have suggestions for the bot, feel free to send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Techniack).

## Where Can I Get It?
You can use [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=789331222815047740&permissions=1611656256&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to invite the bot I host. If you would like to build your own copy of bot, please send me a message so I can give you a copy of the code.
